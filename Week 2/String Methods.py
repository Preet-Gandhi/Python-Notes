#What are Mehotds in python?
'''They're a type of function/command used on other functions.
In this cas eit's specificly used for strings.
    print(x.lower()) prints x in lower case
    print(x.upper()) prints x in upper case
    print(x.capitalize()) capitilizes first character
    print(x.title()) capitilizes first character of each word
    print(x.swapcase()) swaps cases in text. i.e lowercase -> uppercase and uppercase -> lowercase
    print(x.islower()) true if all characters are lower, false if any one is upper
    print(x.isupper()) is true if all characters are upper case, false if any one is lower
    print(x.istitle()) is true if string follows rules of title, else false
    print(x.isdiget()) true if all characters are numbers, else false
    print(x.isalpha()) true if all characters are alphabets, else false
    print(x.isalnum()) true if all characters in the string are either numbers or alphabets
    ie. if entire string is alphanumerical
    @.#$%^&*(_) don't count as numbers ; they're special characters
    x = "---Python---"
    print(x.strip()) trims both sides of stirng -> Python
    print(x.lstrip()) trims left side of string  -> Python---
    print(x.rstrip()) trims right side of string -> ---Python
    strip cleans the string
    print(x.startswith("y")) -> returns true if x starts with y , false if Y or a or anythign else
    print(x.endswith("a")) -> .startswith but applies to last character of string
    print(x.count("y")) -> counts number of times a certain character appears in a string
    print(x.index("a")) -> searches string and returns index of the given character
    print(x.replace("B","b")) -> searches and replaces all B with b
    thing to check -> if we can put a var inside of  () ; especily in the "" and the "",""
