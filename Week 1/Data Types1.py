What are strings, integers and floats?
Int means integer. Float means any number other than int.
the comp automaticly knows the datay type being stored.
The compputer alocates memory location for it to be stored.
All types of data won't have same point. It declares the data type and stores it's value

L= [10,20,30]
print(L)
print(L[0]) 
print(type(L))
#the first element of L is represented by 0. It's the zeroth value.
#list is a type of data type in python. The computer also knwos what to store as which data set 
 #what if i do print(type(L[2]))?
print(type(L[2]))
#it will print 30, the second element of the list. L is a list. [2]
#draws our attention/refers towards that particular paramater.
#that paramater is an integer. thus type(L[2]) is int.
